I graduated with a Computer Science B.S. from <Underlining>UC Santa Cruz</Underlining> in 2021.

I enjoy working on both the front end and back end of a project.

Outside of coding, I love the ocean, listening to music, the ukulele, trying out new recipes, watching anime, and hanging out with pugs.
